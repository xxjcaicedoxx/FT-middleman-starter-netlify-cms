  title: Great coffee with a conscience
story: >-
Flattop is a neighborhood restaurant looking to provide a pause to the hustle and bustle of what Harlem and Morningside offers.
With a wide variety of menu items for Lunch, Brunch, Dinner and Happy-Hour, we looks to bring fresh ingredients to the table,
with a lively and rustic ambiance.  Come hang out and sip some Rioja by the bar, or hang with friends and family in our main dinning area.
Whatever you decide, the Flattop team looks forward to having you.
